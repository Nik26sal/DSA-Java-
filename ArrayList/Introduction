Ques1. What is ArrayList?
Answer. ArrayList is a Java class implemented using the List interface. 
        Java ArrayList, as the name suggests, provides the functionality of a dynamic array 
        where the size is not fixed as an array. 
        Also, as a part of the Collections framework, it has many features not available with arrays.
        Initial Capcity of ArrayList is about 10.
        if the size become full and the user add the new element then it make a new memory in heap with double size 
        or copy all the element from ArrayList first to other then add that Element.
        ArrayList is a Class implements list Inteface and Extends the Collections.
        Started from index 0.

    ----Methods used in ArrayList:-
       1.add(index,element)
       2.add(element)
       3.addAll(Collection c)
       4.addAll(index,Collection c)
       5.clear() // Remove all elements from ArrayList
       6.clone() // give Shallow Copy of ArrayList
       7.contains(element) // give boolean answer
       8.indexOf(elememt) // give index of element otherwise -1
       9.get(index) // element on the given index
       10.isEmpty() // give boolean value
       11.lastIndexOf(element)
       12.remove(element)
       13.remove(index)
       14.size() // the length of ArrayList that filled
       15.toArray() // return Array

--These are some methods that used mostly but to read other method explore self
