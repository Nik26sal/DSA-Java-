Trees are the type of Non-linear DataStructure.
it has only two Nodes.leftNode and right Node;
the Node that has no left Node and right Node or the value of both is null then that node is called as Leaf Node;
Root Node is the Node where the trees Become start
Left nOde and right Node of of Node is called as Child Node of a parent Node.
Type of Binary tree:
1.Fully Binary Tree:-
                    -It is also called as Strict Binary tree.
                    -It is a type of Tree in which Every Node of Binary Tree have exactly Two Node or Zero Node as Child
2.Complete Binary Tree:-
                    -A Complete Binary Tree is a specialised form of Binary Tree where all levels are filled completely except possibly the 
                     last level,which is filled from left to right.
                    -All levels of the tree, except possibly the last one, are fully filled. If the last level is not completely filled,
                     it is filled from left to right, ensuring that nodes are positioned as far left as possible.
                    -Index of Node is increase by one .
3.Perfect Binary tree:-
                     -A Perfect Binary tree is a type of Binary Tree where all leaf nodes are at the same level and 
                      the number of leaf nodes is maximised for that level.
                     -Every node in a perfect binary tree has either zero or two children. 
                      This means that every internal node (non-leaf node) has exactly two children and 
                      all leaf nodes are at the same level.All levels of this tree are fully filled with nodes including 
                      the last level. 
4.Balanced Binary Tree:-
                     -A Balanced Binary tree is a type of Binary Tree where the heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one. 
                     -The left Height of Node - The right height of Node is equals to 1 then called as complete Binary tree.
5.Degenerated Tree:-
                  A Degenerate Tree is a Binary Tree where the nodes are arranged in a single path leaning to the right or left.
