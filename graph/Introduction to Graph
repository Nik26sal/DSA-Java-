Ques1. What is Graph?
Answer. Graphs are data structures that have a wide-ranging application in real life. 
        These include analysis of electrical circuits, finding the shortest routes between two places, building navigation 
        systems like Google Maps, even social media using graphs to store data about each user, etc.
        It is a non-linear data-structure.

Ques2. Type of Graph?
Answer. 1.Directed Graph      1.Cyclic Graph     1.Symmetric Graph    1.Weighted Graph
        2.Undirected Graph    2.Acyclic Graph    2.Asymmetric Graph   2.Unweighted Graph

Ques3.Components of Graph?
Answer. Edges(line Connecting two nodes or vertices) and vertex(Nodes) are the Components of Graph

Ques4.Total no. of Degree in an Undirected Graph?
Answer. 2 * Total No. of Edges in the Graph is Equal to the total number  degree in the graph.

Ques5. What is BFS technique?.
Answer. BFS means Breadth First Search. In this the level Wise technique is Used.It is Mostly used to solve the Matrix Problems also
        Neighbouring Traversal is also called to it(Not book but given by me).Queue is Used in it.

Ques6. What is DFS technique in Graph?
Answer. DFS means Deapth First Search.In this the path wise traversal is Used.In it Recursion is Used to implement it.
